Kubernetes Cost Monitoring &amp; Optimization
# 🔍 KubeCost Alternative – Kubernetes Cost Monitoring & Optimization

A flexible, open-source solution for tracking and optimizing Kubernetes costs across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments. Built with Prometheus, Python, and optional UIs like Streamlit or Grafana.

---

## 🌟 Vision

This project aims to create a **transparent, customizable, and vendor-agnostic alternative to Kubecost**, enabling organizations to:

- Track real-time resource usage and cost at pod, namespace, or label level
- Integrate actual cloud pricing or on-prem cost models
- Visualize trends, anomalies, and opportunities for cost savings
- Deploy in cloud, hybrid, or air-gapped environments

---

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

- **Prometheus** – metrics collection and querying
- **Python** – cost attribution engine
- **Streamlit / Grafana** – dashboards and UI
- **TimescaleDB / PostgreSQL (optional)** – historical data storage
- **Kubernetes** – native deployment via Helm/Operators
- **Cloud APIs or static pricing** – flexible pricing models

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

| Stage | Features | Goal |
|-------|----------|------|
| ✅ **Stage 1 – MVP** | Basic CPU & memory cost attribution using Prometheus + Python CLI | Prove core logic and metrics integration |
| 🔄 **Stage 2 – Visual Dashboards** | Add Streamlit and/or Grafana support | Make data easily explorable |
| 🔄 **Stage 3 – Historical Tracking** | Store cost data in TimescaleDB or Prometheus TSDB | Enable trending and forecasting |
| 🔄 **Stage 4 – Cloud Cost Integration** | Fetch dynamic prices from AWS/GCP/Azure or custom YAML | Match usage to real-world costs |
| 🔄 **Stage 5 – Reporting & Alerting** | Slack/email reports, alerts for anomalies | Operationalize insights |
| 🔄 **Stage 6 – Advanced Attribution** | Include GPU, storage, egress, and shared cost splits | Full-stack cost insight |
| 🔄 **Stage 7 – Enterprise Features** | Multi-cluster support, RBAC, usage quotas | Production-ready adoption |
